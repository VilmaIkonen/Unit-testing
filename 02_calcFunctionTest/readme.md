## Workflow of testing

1. Create API for the module to be tested
2. Design test cases based on the API
3. Program the tests
4. Test/run the tests (they should all fail as there is not anything to test yet)
5. Implement module to be tested
6. Run tests
7. Inspect results in the report
8. If errors, fix them and run tests again
